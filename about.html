    <p>The Mission of The Bronx Charter School for Children is to empower our children to achieve their greatest potential both as students and as members of their communities.
        Our elementary school building currently offers 18 classrooms, all at least 800 square feet in size and filled with natural light and color, as well as an expanded cafeteria and several new spaces designed for small group learning and administrative offices. We have a gymnasium, a music room and an art studio in our school building and we have recently added a technology lab.
